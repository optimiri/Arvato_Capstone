# Create a Customer Segmentation Report for Arvato Financial Solutions
In this project, I analyzed demographics data for customers of a mail-order sales company in Germany, compared it against
demographics information for the general population. I used unsupervised learning techniques to perform customer segmentation,
identified the parts of the population that best describe the core customer base of the company. Then, I applied
what I've learned on a third dataset with demographics information for targets of a marketing campaign for the company and
used a model to predict which individuals are most likely to convert into becoming customers for the company. The data that I used has been provided by our partners at Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics. The project and results are dicussed on Medium: https://medium.com/@gavana911/understand-your-current-customers-and-identify-who-might-be-new-potentially-a-new-customer-using-3acdd4ab262f

## Project Motivation
To showcase the skills I learned throwout Udacity Data Science Nanodegree and practice unsupervised and supervised machine learning
skills and complete the capstone project.
